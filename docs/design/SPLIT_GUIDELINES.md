The common split strategies for structuring training within a week are determined by the **number of days a user can realistically train** (2 to 6 days), and the necessity to train each muscle group or movement pattern a minimum of **two or more times per week**.

The optimal split strategy often depends on managing workload capacity, as higher weekly volume requirements (common for intermediate and advanced trainees) necessitate spreading the work over more sessions to maintain session quality. The recommended default frequency for most individuals is **3–5 days per week**.

The following matrices outline common split strategies based on training days per week, categorized by training goal:

### I. Hypertrophy Split Strategies (Bodybuilding Focus)

For hypertrophy, splits are often categorized by which major body part or movement pattern is trained on a given day, or whether it is a "Full Body" day (meaning the session trains all major muscle groups).

| Days Per Week | Common Split Strategies (Muscle Group Frequency Per Week) |
| :---: | :--- |
| **2 Days** | Full Body, Full Body (Frequency of 2) |
| **3 Days** | Lower, Upper, Full Body |
| | Full Body, Full Body, Full Body (Frequency of 3) |
| **4 Days** | Lower, Upper, Lower, Upper (Frequency of 2) |
| | Legs, Push, Pull, Full Body (Frequency of 3) |
| | Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Full Body (Frequency of 4) |
| **5 Days** | Legs, Push, Pull, Lower, Upper (Frequency of 2) |
| | Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Upper, Lower (Frequency of 4) |
| | Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Full Body (Frequency of 5) |
| **6 Days** | Legs, Push, Pull, Legs, Push, Pull (Frequency of 2) |
| | **Lower, Upper, Lower, Upper, Lower, Upper** (Frequency of 3) |
| | Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Legs, Push, Pull (Frequency of 4) |
| | Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Upper, Lower (Frequency of 5) |
| | Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Full Body, Full Body (Frequency of 6) |

### II. Strength Split Strategies (Powerlifting Focus)

For strength training, splits are often organized around the frequency of the three main competition movements: **Squat (S)**, **Bench (B)**, and **Deadlift (D)**. The notation "S/B" or "B/D" indicates that those lifts are performed in the same session.

| Days Per Week | Common Split Strategies (Movement Frequency Per Week) |
| :---: | :--- |
| **2 Days** | S/B, B/D (Frequency of 2) |
| **3 Days** | S/B, B, D (Frequency of 3) |
| | S/B, B/D, S/B (Frequency of 4) |
| **4 Days** | S, B, D, B (Frequency of 2) |
| | S/B, B, D, S/B (Frequency of 3) |
| | S/B, B/D, S/B, B/D (Frequency of 4) |
| **5 Days** | S, B, D, B, Accessories (Frequency of 2) |
| | S/B, B, D, S/B, Accessories (Frequency of 3) |
| | S/B, B/D, S/B, B/D, Accessories (Frequency of 4) |
| | S/B, B/D, S/B, B/D, S/B (Frequency of 5) |
| **6 Days** | S, B, D, B, Accessories, Accessories (Frequency of 2) |
| | S, B, D, B, S, B (Frequency of 3) |
| | S, B, D, B, S/B, B/D (Frequency of 4) |
| | S/B, B, D, S/B, B/D, S/B (Frequency of 5) |
| | **S/B, B/D, S/B, B/D, S/B, B/D** (Frequency of 6) |

### Contextual Factors Influencing Split Choice

The choice of split must be **Realistic, Enjoyable, and Flexible (REF)** to ensure adherence.

1.  **Volume and Training Age:** Your split choice must accommodate your required weekly volume. Generally, a higher training age necessitates a higher weekly volume, which in turn usually requires higher frequency (more days) to split the volume into manageable sessions:
    *   **Novices** start with 10–12 weekly sets and typically train 2–3 times per week. A novice can make a two-day program work, but progress often stalls if complexity increases.
    *   **Intermediates** use 13–15 weekly sets and typically train 3–4 times per week.
    *   **Advanced** trainees use 16–20 weekly sets and typically train 3–5 times per week.

2.  **Session Length:** Choosing a higher training frequency (e.g., 6 days of full body) results in fewer exercises and sets per session, leading to shorter workouts. Choosing a lower frequency (e.g., 2 days of full body) results in more volume per session, leading to longer, more fatiguing workouts.

3.  **Fatigue Management:** Increasing the frequency of training is the way to organize training to improve the relationship between stress and recovery, ensuring no single session becomes overly taxing. For instance, a high-frequency protocol for strength athletes requires careful thought regarding the fatigue **overlap** between heavy compound lifts (like squats and deadlifts).
