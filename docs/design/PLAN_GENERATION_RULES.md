This comprehensive planning structure is organized based on the user's **Training Age** (Novice, Intermediate, Advanced), which dictates the required complexity of the periodization model, the expected rate of progress, and the volume baseline.

The periodization models (Linear, Block, Undulating) function primarily as organizational tools—Linear for structure, Block for long-term specialization (Macro-cycles), and Undulating for weekly variety (Micro-cycles).

## I. Planning Principles by Training Age (Progression & Periodization)

The planning framework ensures that the initial weekly training volume aligns with the user's experience level, and that the complexity of the progression matches the required rate of adaptation.

| Training Age | Periodization Model Used | Core Progression Mechanism | Volume Baseline (Sets/Wk) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Novice** | Simple/Linear Load Increases | **Single Progression** (Load increases session-to-session) | **10–12 sets** per muscle/movement |
| **Intermediate** | Linear Periodization (Wave Loading, Meso-cycle focus) | **Wave Loading** (Load increases as reps decrease over 3 weeks) + **Double Progression** for accessories | **13–15 sets** per muscle/movement |
| **Advanced** | Block Periodization (Macro-cycle focus) | Phase-specific changes (Accumulation: Volume focus; Intensification: Load focus) | **16–20 sets** per muscle/movement |

### 1. Novice Trainee (Micro-cycle Progression)

For novices, the planning priority is simplicity, mastering movement, and achieving linear gains.

| Planning Component | Principle/Guideline | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Progression/Load** | Use **Single Progression**: increase load while keeping sets/reps static. Increments are typically 5–10 lbs (Lower Body) or 2.5–5 lbs (Upper Body). | |
| **Failure/Stall Logic** | If **missed reps** occur in **two consecutive sessions**, apply a **10% load reduction (RESET)** for the subsequent session, then return to the stalled load. | |
| **Intensity** | Use **Percentage of 1RM (%1RM)** for compound lifts as training guidance, not RPE initially. Log RPE to learn the skill of self-assessment. | |

### 2. Intermediate Trainee (Meso-cycle Progression)

Intermediates use **Linear Periodization** structured around **3-week Wave Loading cycles** (meso-cycles) to manage increasing fatigue.

| Planning Component | Principle/Guideline | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Compound Progression** | **Wave Loading:** Load increases each week while repetitions decrease (e.g., Strength focus: 8, 7, 6 reps; Hypertrophy focus: 12, 10, 8 reps). Base Load is increased by 5–10 lbs after a successful block. | |
| **Accessory Progression** | **Double Progression:** Keep load fixed while attempting to increase reps within a predefined range (e.g., 12–15). Only increase load when the top of the range is hit for all sets, then reset reps to the bottom of the range. | |
| **Deload (Reactive)** | After a 3-week cycle, perform a **Post-Block Assessment** (checklist: sleep, stress, aches, dreading gym, loads decreasing). If **2 or more** answers are negative, schedule a **Deload Week** (50% volume, maintained load/reduced reps to lower RPE). | |
| **Mandatory Deload** | A deload must be **forced every third mesocycle** regardless of the assessment score to prevent non-functional overreaching. | |

### 3. Advanced Trainee (Macro-cycle Progression)

Advanced lifters require **Block Periodization** to manage fatigue and specialize adaptation over long macro-cycles.

| Block Phase (Meso-cycle) | Primary Goal & Settings | Progression Focus | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accumulation** (4–6 weeks) | Hypertrophy & Work Capacity. **Sets: 4–5**, **Reps: 8–15**, **RPE: 6–8**. | Prioritize adding **Sets or Reps** first, then Load. Volume increases progressively (e.g., from 12 sets/wk to 22 sets/wk). | |
| **Intensification** (3–4 weeks) | Specific Strength. **Sets: 3–4**, **Reps: 3–6**, **RPE: 7–9.5**. | Prioritize adding **Load** aggressively, dropping overall volume. | |
| **Realization** (1–2 weeks) | Tapering/Peaking. Volume drops to **50% of Intensification**; Intensity remains high but RPE is kept low (<7). | Dissipate fatigue to express maximal strength. | |
| **Introductory Cycle** | When transitioning from Intensification (low volume, high RPE) back to Accumulation (high volume, low RPE), apply **75% of target volume** and **RPE -1** for the first week to prevent excessive soreness and acclimate the user. | |

## II. Guiding Principles for Systematic Planning

These principles cover the foundational layers of the Muscle & Strength Pyramid, ensuring the program is systematically structured, goal-specific, and flexible.

### 1. Volume and Frequency Management (Level 2)

| Principle | Guideline | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Volume Definition** | Volume is quantified by the total **number of sets** performed in a given week. | |
| **Overlap Rule** | When calculating weekly volume, compound exercises contribute volume (sets x coefficient) to **secondary muscle groups** (e.g., Squats contribute 1.0 to Quads/Glutes, 0.5 to Adductors/Erectors). | |
| **Frequency Minimum** | Every muscle group or movement pattern must be trained a minimum of **2+ times per week** to optimize strength and hypertrophy responses. | |

### 2. Intensity and Specificity (Goal Alignment)

The distribution of intensity (rep ranges) must be adjusted according to the primary goal.

| Goal Focus | Primary Volume (⅔ – ¾ of total volume) | Specificity Requirement | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strength** | **1–6 Rep Range** (Heavy loads). | **50–75%** of total training volume must come from competition lifts (or their direct variants). | |
| **Hypertrophy** | **6–12 Rep Range** (Moderate loads for efficient volume). | Use **1–2 Compound** movements and **1–3 Isolation** movements per major muscle group for balanced development. | |
| **RPE Usage** | **RPE (Repetitions in Reserve)** is the primary metric for measuring intensity of effort and auto-regulating load. Target RPE generally ranges from **5–10** depending on the training phase. | |
| **Exercise Order** | **Compound/Multi-joint** exercises must be sequenced before Isolation/Single-joint exercises. | |

### 3. Flexibility and Auto-Regulation (Adherence & Adjustment)

The program structure must be **Realistic, Enjoyable, and Flexible (REF)** to promote adherence over time.

| Adjustment Area | Adjustment Mechanism | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Scheduling Interruptions** | If a session is missed, provide options: **'Shift'** (Recommended: push the schedule back, preserving order), **'Skip'** (only low-stress/accessory focused sessions), or **'Combine'** (merge key lifts, but reduce volume of secondary lifts by 30–50% for fatigue management). | |
| **Intra-Workout Load** | **RPE Adjustment Logic:** If the actual RPE is consistently 1.0 or more above the target RPE, decrease the load by 2–5% for the next set to manage daily readiness. | |
| **Efficiency/Time Saving** | Allow the user to toggle **Antagonist Paired Sets (APS)** for time-saving. APS should be restricted to upper body compounds and isolation movements, excluding full-body movements (Squats, Deadlifts, heavy Lunges) due to excessive fatigue. | |
| **Accessory Intensity** | For time constraints, allow accessory exercises to be converted to **Drop Sets** or **Rest-Pause Sets**; restrict these high-fatigue techniques to non-barbell/accessory movements. | |
| **Long Hiatus** | If a user returns after a break longer than 14 days, force a **20% load reduction** for the first session back to safely rebuild work capacity. | |
| **Autoregulated Deloads** | Intermediate and Advanced programs rely on the Post-Block Assessment checklist (Score 2+ negative recovery factors) to trigger reactive deloads, ensuring the low-stress period matches physiological need. | |

### Analogy

Planning a systematic training program based on these principles is like **designing and piloting a commercial airplane**. The **Novice** phase is simply learning how to take off and land successfully (linear load progression on fundamental lifts). The **Intermediate** phase requires calculating fuel usage (volume management) and flight path adjustments (wave loading mesocycles) to avoid running out of energy (reactive deloading). The **Advanced** phase involves long-term, specialized mission planning (**Block Periodization**), where the plane shifts focus—loading up maximum cargo capacity (**Accumulation**) before prioritizing maximum speed (**Intensification**) and then shedding all unnecessary weight to hit peak performance on the runway (**Realization/Taper**). Throughout the entire journey, constant feedback (RPE/Auto-regulation) acts as the air traffic control, providing flexibility to adjust speed, altitude, or routing based on current wind conditions or mechanical performance, ensuring the mission is completed successfully despite unexpected turbulence (life stress/missed workouts).
